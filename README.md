# Paper-Stone-Scissors Game
This is a simple Windows Forms application implementing the classic Paper-Stone-Scissors game. The game allows a player to compete against the computer in a series of rounds, where each chooses either paper, stone, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

## Getting Started
To run this application, you'll need Visual Studio (or another C# development environment) installed on your machine. Once you have the code, you can open the solution file (P4_Paper_Stone_Scissors.sln) in Visual Studio and build/run the project.

## Game Rules
* Paper beats Stone
* Stone beats Scissors
* Scissors beats Paper
* If both the player and the computer choose the same item, it's a draw for that round.

## Features
* Player can select their choice of Paper, Stone, or Scissors using radio buttons.
* Computer randomly selects its choice.
* After each round, the winner is displayed, and the score is updated accordingly.
* The game keeps track of the number of rounds played, player wins, computer wins, and draws.
